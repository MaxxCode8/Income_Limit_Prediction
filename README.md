<b>Binary Classification Problem | Predicting Income Limit (Above/Below) | XGBoost </b> 
<br>
### New Things i learnt/ got exposed to :
evidently ( library with many evaluation features.... like data drift)
shap (XAi)
classification_report library ( bundled metrics library for classification problems)
> we can drop categorical columns which have too many classes ( household_stat )
> boxplot and other plots can be plotted to see the outliers in data
> when there are categorical columns in our data / observing individual distribution with the target variable is important
> Need to play more with different plots for different use-cases!

Fixes & Improvements : 
1. Unclear how to use pickled encoders and scalers ? { incorrect results in deployment }
2. Need to read documentation and try out different encoders
