<b>Binary Classification Problem | Predicting Income Limit (Above/Below) | XGBoost </b> 
<br>
### New Things i learnt/ got exposed to :<br>

evidently ( library with many evaluation features.... like data drift)<br>
shap (XAi)<br>
classification_report library ( bundled metrics library for classification problems)<br>

Fixes & Improvements : <br>
1. we can drop categorical columns which have too many classes ( household_stat )<br>
2. boxplot and other plots can be plotted to see the outliers in data<br>
3. when there are categorical columns in our data / observing individual distribution with the target variable is important<br>
4. Need to play more with different plots for different use-cases!<br>
5. Unclear how to use pickled encoders and scalers ? { incorrect results in deployment }... Need to read documentation and try out different encoders <br>
